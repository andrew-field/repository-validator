    ```
    * Scanning single repository, reporting to console and creating pull requests when possible.
    ```
    dotnet run -- scan-selected -r repository-validator
    ```
  * Azure functions (GitHub WebHook for pushes)
    * Scan selected repository and report to GitHub issues and application insights

For usage instructions:
```

```

### Configuration (this project)

Configuration parameters are read from appsettings.json-file for both, ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions and Runner.
#### Console runner
For Runner
```
{
    "GitHub": {
        "Token": "token generated in github",
        "Organization": "organization name"
    },
    "Slack": {
        "WebHookUrl": "slack web hook url here",
        "ReportLimit": 20
    },
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Trace"
        }
    }
}
```

When developing, create appsettings.Development.json and
replace configuration values with personal values
and use `setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT "Development"` to set environment

#### Azure Functions
For Azure functions, configurations are read from Web site config.
See `Deployment/azuredeploy.json` and `Deployment`-section for configuration.

For local development and testing of Azure functions, see [function local development documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local)

GitHub needs Azure Function's webhook url for `ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions.RepositoryValidator.cs`.
This can be fetched with `Deployment/GetFunctionUri.ps1` or manually from Azure Portal. This url can be configured organization wide or seperately for each repository. See GitHub documentation for instructions.

### Configuration (validated repositories)

Each repository may contain `repository-validator.json` file which can be used to configure the way that repository is validated.
Currently it can be used to ignore certain rules by adding the class name to `IgnoredRules` array.

Example `repository-validator.json` file which ignores 4 rules.
```
{
    "Version": "1",
    "IgnoredRules": [
        "HasDescriptionRule",
        "HasNewestPtcsJenkinsLibRule",
        "HasReadmeRule"
        "HasLicenseRule"
    ]
}
```

## Deployment
Project ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions can be deployed to Azure as Azure Function.
This function periodically validates repositories and reports to configured channel

These deployment examples uses powershell, but this can also be done otherwise.

NOTE: PowerShell needs to have an authenticated sessions. This can be done with `Connect-AzureRmAccount`.

### Creating environment

Deployment\azuredeploy.json contains definition of environment. It can be deployed in multiple ways, but here are few examples

Azure PowerShell module
```
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
    -Name deployment-name `
    -TemplateFile Deployment/azuredeploy.json `
    -ResourceGroupName my-resource-group `
    -appName my-app-name `
    -gitHubToken "your github token here" `
    -gitHubOrganization "your github organization here" `
    -slackWebhookUrl "your slack webhook url here" `
    -environment "Development"
```

az cli
```
az group deployment create -g "github-test" --template-file Deployment/azuredeploy.json --parameters appName=hjni-test --parameters gitHubToken=<tokenhere> --parameters gitHubOrganization=protacon --parameters slackWebhookUrl=<slackwebhook>
```

### Deploying site

Pack ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions into directory
```
dotnet publish -c Release -o my-publish-directory ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions
```

Create Zip file for deployment
```
./Deployment/Zip.ps1 -Destination "publish.zip" -PublishFolder "ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions/my-publish-directory"
```

Use Deployment/Deploy.ps1
```
./Deployment/Deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup "my-resource-group" -WebAppName "my-app-name" -ZipFilePath "publish.zip"
```

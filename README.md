```
dotnet build
```

## Usage

In development (while in solution folder)
```
dotnet run --project Runner
```

### Configuration

Configuration parameters are read from appsettings.json-file. 
```
{
    "Token": "token generated in github",
    "Organization": "organization name"
}
```

## Deployment
Project ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions can be deployed to Azure as Azure Function.
This function periodically validates repositories and reports to configured channel

These deployment examples uses pwoershell, but this can also be done otherwise.

NOTE: PowerShell needs to have an authenticated sessions. This can be done with `Connect-AzureRmAccount`.

### Creating environment

Deployment\azuredeploy.json contains definition of environment. It can be deployed in multiple ways, but here are few examples

Azure PowerShell module
```
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment `
    -Name deployment-name `
    -TemplateFile Deployment/azuredeploy.json `
    -ResourceGroupName my-resource-group `
    -appName my-app-name `
    -gitHubToken "your github token here" `
    -gitHubOrganization "your github organization here" `
    -slackWebhookUrl "your slack webhook url here"
```

az cli
```
az group deployment create -g "github-test" --template-file Deployment/azuredeploy.json --parameters appName=hjni-test
```

### Deploying site

Pack ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions into directory
```
dotnet publish -c Release -o my-publish-directory ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions
```

Create Zip file for deployment
```
./Deployment/Zip.ps1 -Destination "publish.zip" -PublishFolder "ValidationLibrary.AzureFunctions/my-publish-directory"
```

Use Deployment/Deploy.ps1
```
./Deployment/Deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup "my-resource-group" -WebAppName "my-app-name" -ZipFilePath "publish.zip"
```
